## 🖥️ Prerequisites: Development Environment

This project targets Linux (native, WSL, remote VM, or a VS Code Dev Container):

- If you don't already have it, install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on your
  **host machine** first. For **WSL**, add the
  [Remote - WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
  ("WSL: Connect to WSL"); for a **remote VM**, add the
  [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
  ("Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...").
- **macOS / native Linux:** already Unix-based — skip ahead to Quick Start.
- **Windows:** use **WSL** ([install guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)).
- **Remote VM** (AWS/Azure/GCP/on-prem): provision a Linux base and connect over SSH.
- **VS Code Dev Container:** open this folder in VS Code and let it build `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.

You'll need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed to manage the virtual
environment and dependencies, and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) if you
plan to use `make build-container`/`make run-container` (the Dev Container installs both
automatically).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Once your environment is ready, get the project up and running in seconds after cloning the
repository:

```bash
make setup    # Initialize venv, .env, generate settings, and verify environment
make check    # Run QA checks (linting) and tests
make run      # Run the main application
```

To verify everything end-to-end before a commit:
```bash
make all      # clean -> setup -> check -> run
```

## Configuration

The project uses a single source of truth for settings defined in `settings.yaml`.

1. Run `make setup` to initialize your `.env` file from `.env.example`.
2. Edit `.env` to fill in any secret values (e.g. `EXAMPLE_SERVICE_API_KEY`).
3. The application validates these at runtime using Pydantic Settings (`src/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}/data_model.py`).
4. After editing `settings.yaml`, run `make generate-data-model` to regenerate `data_model.py` and `.env.example`.

## Common Workflows

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make help` | Show all targets with their descriptions |
| `make setup` | Full environment initialization and verification |
| `make install` | Sync deps and install pre-commit hooks (run after cloning) |
| `make check` | Run `qa` (linting) and `test` (unit tests) |
| `make update` | Upgrade lockfile, sync deps, update pre-commit hooks |
| `make generate-data-model` | Regenerate `data_model.py`/`.env.example` from `settings.yaml` |
| `make ssl-check` | Detect and configure SSL CA bundle (for networks with SSL inspection) |
| `make qa` | Run pre-commit hooks (ruff, pyrefly, config drift check, etc.) |
| `make test` | Run the pytest suite |
| `make unused-packages` | Detect unused packages (deptry) |
| `make all` | Full end-to-end verification pipeline: clean, setup, check, run |
| `make build` | Build the distributable package |
| `make build-container` | Build the Docker image (uses layer cache) |
| `make build-container-clean` | Force a full rebuild of the Docker image (no cache) |
| `make run-container` | Build (cached) and run the Docker container |
| `make clean` | Remove `.venv`, caches, and artifacts (with `.env` backup) |
| `make zip` | Zip git-tracked files into `project.zip` |
| `make run` | Execute the main application |
| `make hello-world` | Run the hello-world demonstration tool |
| `make check-service` | Check connectivity to the example external service |

Each tool target is a thin wrapper around a `uv run` console script — they're declared under
`[project.scripts]` in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) and can be run directly without `make`,
e.g. `uv run {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}-hello-world`.

## AI Coding Agents

This project ships agent-agnostic instructions centered on [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (security
rules, human-in-the-loop protocol, verification requirements) and [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md)
(architecture and coding standards). Tool-specific entry points just point back to these two
files:

| Tool | Entry point |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) |
| Gemini CLI | [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md) |
| GitHub Copilot | [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) |

`.copilotignore` and `.geminiignore` additionally instruct those tools to never read `.env`,
`*.pem`, `*.key`, or `**/secrets*`/`**/credentials*` files.
