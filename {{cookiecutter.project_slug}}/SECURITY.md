# Security

## Deployment Hardening Checklist

Before deploying {{cookiecutter.project_name}} to production, verify every item below:

### Environment & Secrets

- [ ] `.env` file is NOT committed (verify `.gitignore` excludes `.env*`)
- [ ] All secrets use `SecretStr` (never logged in plaintext)
- [ ] `gitleaks` pre-commit hook is active (detects accidental secret commits)
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code

### Configuration

- [ ] `settings.yaml` ↔ `data_model.py` are in sync (run `make generate-data-model` / the `*-config-drift-check` script)
- [ ] All mandatory fields have regex validation in `settings.yaml`
- [ ] `fail_on_missing: true` in global settings (app fails fast on missing vars)

### API & Network

- [ ] HTTP request timeouts configured for all external API calls
- [ ] Rate limiting / retry logic with exponential backoff enabled where applicable
- [ ] No debug logging of user input/PII in production
- [ ] Server host is NOT `0.0.0.0` unless behind a reverse proxy

### Subprocess Safety

- [ ] All subprocess calls use argument lists (never `shell=True`)
- [ ] Executable paths validated with `shutil.which()` before execution

### Dependencies

- [ ] `uv.lock` reviewed for unexpected changes
- [ ] No known CVEs in dependency tree (`uv audit` — enforced by `make qa` and CI)
- [ ] Dependabot alerts and version-update PRs triaged (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks enforced in CI

### Container & Supply Chain

- [ ] Image builds with a pinned uv version and runs as a non-root user (UID 1000)
- [ ] No HIGH/CRITICAL fixable CVEs in the image (CI `container-scan` job: Trivy + SBOM)
- [ ] GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs with `permissions: contents: read`
- [ ] Full-history secret scan passes (CI `gitleaks` job)

## Known Patterns & Mitigations

### Secret Logging Prevention

All secrets use Pydantic `SecretStr`. When displaying:
```python
val = "****" + secret.get_secret_value()[-4:] if secret else "None"
```

### Env Drift Detection

Generated `data_model.py` contains a SHA-256 hash of the source YAML.
Run the `*-config-drift-check` console script (wired into `make qa`, and so into CI) to verify sync.
